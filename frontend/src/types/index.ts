/**
 * Type Definitions Export Module
 * 
 * This module serves as the central export point for all TypeScript type definitions
 * used throughout the Minden Airport Frontend application. It provides a single
 * import location for all type definitions, improving maintainability and reducing
 * import complexity across the codebase.
 * 
 * Exported type categories:
 * - auth: User authentication and authorization types
 * - api: API request/response and error handling types
 * - flight: Flight, airline, airport, and status types
 * - ticket: Ticket and booking related types
 * - baggage: Baggage tracking and management types
 * - admin: Administrative dashboard and management types
